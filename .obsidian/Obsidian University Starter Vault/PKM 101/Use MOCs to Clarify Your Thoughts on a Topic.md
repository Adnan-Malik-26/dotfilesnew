Awhile back, I went through the [Linking Your Thinking](https://www.linkingyourthinking.com/?via=mike-schmitz) workshop by Nick Milo. One of the big things I picked up from the workshop was the idea of _Maps of Content_ (or MOCs).

Nick described a Map of Content as a sort of mental workbench that you use to figure out your thoughts on a topic. I really like this approach, and I've been using it whenever I feel a "mental squeeze point" where I'm not quite sure what I think about something.

It could be a problem I'm trying to solve. It could be a new topic I'm just curious about. It could be an area or practice I want to improve. For me, whenever I feel like I need to spend some time noodling more on something, it's a clue to create a Map of Content.

Here's the process I use:

1. Create a new note in Obsidian titled **MOC - Topic** (i.e. MOC - Habits)
2. Start collecting bits of information that I feel are important for the topic in the note
3. Force myself to write down a reaction to the information I've collected

The third step is where the magic happens. By making myself _decide what I think_ about something, I find I gain a lot of clarity from the information I've collected.

There's an old adage that goes:

_"Thoughts disentangle themselves passing over the lips and through pencil tips."_

I'd add, "and also clicky keyboards in Obsidian."

The next time you get stuck or are simply feeling overwhelmed, try making an MOC. Jot down a couple of things and force yourself to have an opinion about what you've collected. You might just find that you've had the answer inside you all along.

If you want to dive deeper into the topic of MOCs, here's a YouTube video I created that walks through my MOC on habits:
