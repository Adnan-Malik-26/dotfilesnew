This tip is a little more conceptual, which is to create atomic notes.

I love how James Clear defines atomic in his book, [Atomic Habits](https://www.amazon.com/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break/dp/0735211299?tag=mikeschm-20):

1. an extremely small amount of a thing; the irreducible unit of a larger system.
2. the source of immense energy or power

Therefore, an atomic note is a note that cannot be broken apart any further.

And these atomic notes are also where the power of Obsidian truly lies.

Because each note is a plain text file, I recommend you break apart your notes into the smallest logical pieces. For example, I have a note in my Obsidian vault for book notes from Atomic Habits. But I also have individual notes for the key elements presented there, like the _4 Laws of Behavior Change_ and the _British Cycling Team_.

For my [sermon sketchnotes](https://faithbasedproductivity.com/category/sketchnotes/), I even break down each individual Bible verse into a separate note. This allows me to see which messages are linked by the individual verses that they reference.

The more you break your notes down into smaller pieces, the more you will discover new and interesting connections between them that you hadn't seen before.

P.S. Here's a YouTube video I recorded if you want to dig deeper into the concept of atomic notes:
