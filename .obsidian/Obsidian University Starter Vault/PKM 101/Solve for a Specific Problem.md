Before we get too far, I should share with you one of the most important pieces of advice if you want to make Obsidian stick:

_Pick ONE use case to begin with._

Obsidian is an extremely flexible and powerful app. It can be tempting to try and make it do a bunch of different things. But if you try to do too much at the beginning, none of it will stick.

When I started using Obsidian, I had a single use-case in mind: [create my own cross-reference library for my sermon sketchnotes](https://faithbasedproductivity.com/cross-reference-library-obsidian/). I wanted to be able to connect the sketchnotes I took of my pastor's sermons by the verses that were mentioned. (If you want to see how I did it, [I recorded a video on the process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybO4LtAvjs4).)

If you want to see it in action, I have a published version available [here](https://notes.faithbasedproductivity.com/) (use password **matthew25**).

Once I had this up and running, I slowly added to my Obsidian workflows. Once I started working with my notes in Obsidian, I started to see other places where it made sense to extend my workflows.

But I believe 100% that if I had tried to do it all at once, I would have given up on it quickly. If you want it to stick, build slowly.
