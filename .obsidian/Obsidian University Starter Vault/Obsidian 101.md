**Ready to go even deeper down the Obsidian rabbit hole?**

I have a self-paced video course called [Obsidian 101](https://www.obsidianuniversity.com/101) that is designed to help you lay a solid foundation for your PKM system and accelerate the Obsidian learning curve.

This video course will help you grok the key features of Obsidian quickly so you can start working with Obsidian effectively and get more ideas, insights, and value from your PKM system. The course covers:

- Walkthrough of recommended settings
- The best way to set up and sync your vault
- A breakdown of the Obsidian user interface
- Brief explanations of every single Core Plugin in Obsidian
- A primer on using the *Dataview* plugin

The cost of the course is $97, **but you can apply the whole purchase price toward a future Obsidian University cohort.** In fact, the whole course is a condensed version of 3 separate sessions from the first cohort to help you build a foundational knowledge of Obsidian before diving deeper into more advanced creativity and productivity workflows as you develop your own values-based PKM stack.

And as a thank you for downloading the Obsidian University Starter Vault, you can use coupon code **GRACIAS** at checkout to save an extra $10.
