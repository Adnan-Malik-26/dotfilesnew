PKM is a system, not an app.

The first level of the PKM Stack is *Information*. This is the stuff you consume - the books that you read, the videos you watch, the podcasts you listen to. Some of this information may be important someday and is worth sticking in an archive folder somewhere so you can dig it up when needed, most of it is temporal and doesn't really matter in the long run.

Some of the information that you consume (the higher quality stuff usually) will spark *Ideas*, which leads us to the second level of the PKM Stack. This is stuff you need to develop. Personally, I believe you don't really know what an idea is when you first have it - you need to give it the ideal conditions for it to grow and mature. I believe you need to have a greenhouse for your ideas where you can cultivate them until they are ready, and then the final step is deciding what these things mean for you - and what you're going to do about it.

That leads us to the third level of the PKM stack, which is *Actions*. This is where you take action on those ideas and they become real. There are three types of actions: one-off tasks, multi-step projects, and routines or habits. You can split these into personal and work if you'd like, but the whole concept of work/life balance is one that I don't really agree with. There is just your life, and it's up to you to manage the different aspects of it well. 

Everything that happens at this level is initiated by either an idea you were presented with or information you consumed - either intentionally or unintentionally. Being unintentional about the information you consume causes you to live a "default" life - one that is driven by outside forces. This causes you to consume more information because you're looking for the one thing that can make everything change for the better, leading to FOMO and a general sense of overwhelm because there is just too much information in the world today for you to try and keep up with it all. When you over-consume, you also don't have the time to think about or develop any of the information you've consumed. You just jump from one thing to the next, searching for the next hit of dopamine (which social networks are happy to provide). This leads to a feeling that you just aren't creative because you have trouble coming up with ideas. Actually, you have trouble developing ideas, but it manifests as not being able to be creative because you compare your lack of output with all the stuff you consume, and the comparison trap causes you to feel like you don't have the ability or capacity to create. Then because we have trouble creating (which is really just thinking critically and connecting the dots), we feel that we no agency or choice. We are stuck doing things that we don't want to do, that lack meaning, and are unfulfilling.

In short, we feel stuck.

Notice how this approach works the PKM Stack from the bottom up. This is a reactionary way to live, and it's really stressful. But there is another way, though it requires another layer be added on top.

I call this layer *Philosophy*, because it's really what you consider to be true and how you think about life. This layer is comprised of your vision and values for who you want to be and what you want your life to look like. I actually have a piece of this I call my LifeTheme, which is basically a one-sentence summary of what I want my life to be about. As an example, here's my LifeTheme:

> "I help people find their why, multiply their time & talent, and leave a bigger dent in the universe."

That's my why, the reason behind what I do. I want to help people figure this stuff out for themselves so they can reach their full potential. And if you want to dig deeper into this concept, I actually have a free 5-day email course that walks you through my process. There's a link in the description below this video if you want to sign up for it.

Once you have your philosophy (or ethos would be another good word for this), now you have the potential to flip the script on the default lifestyle. Because once you know your vision and your values, you can start to select the *Actions* that are in alignment with your personal philosophy. You many not actually change any of your actions, but the way you go about them will be different because you'll infuse meaning and purpose into your tasks, projects, and routines since you can see how they are moving you in the right direction. This additional excitement will spark curiosity, and cause you have more and better ideas (though I still advocate for a system to develop them fully). And finally, you'll be more selective about the information you consume because you now have a filter for helping you decide what's worthwhile and what's not. So instead of feeling anxiety and stress from FOMO, you can embrace JOMO - the joy of missing out - by selecting the things that are beneficial and dismissing the things that aren't.

I call this top-down approach "The Intentional Life."

Now once you've made the switch from the default life to the intentional life, it doesn't just stay that way. You have to fight to keep it, which is why a regular reflection practice is so valuable. You need to consistently be asking what's working, what's broken, and how do I fix it.
