My favorite way to manage creative projects is by using kanban boards. A kanban board is simply a board that has a bunch of lists or lanes denoting the different stages of a project. For example, my kanban board has 3 columns: _Backlog_, _In Progress_, and _Done_.

Items in the _Backlog_ have yet to start, items _In Progress_ I'm actively working on, and items that are _Done_ are finished and marked as complete.

So as I work on an article, the flow goes something like this:

_Backlog → In Progress → Done_

This kanban board in Obsidian is made possible by the [Kanban](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-kanban) plugin. Once you install it, you create a kanban board by selecting the **Kanban: Create new Board** command via the Command Palette (accessible by hitting **⌘-P**).

Once you create the board, you can create lists for the different statuses you want to use. Click the **Add a Card** button to create a new card, and you can then drag it from column to column.

A couple other tips for making the most of kanban boards in Obsidian:

1. In the kanban board settings, make sure to enable the **Link to Daily Notes** option. This allows you to set a due date using the date picker (triggered by the **@** symbol when adding a card title) that links to your Daily Notes so you can see when something is due from your Daily Notes backlink section.
2. You can link to other notes in the note titles by using `[[`. I use this method to link to the note where I will actually write the article. This allows me to see what to work on from the kanban board, then click directly on the note for the article to start writing it.

Here's an example of what this looks like:

The link for the title takes me to the note, and the link for the date takes me to the Daily Note for that day.

There are lots of other settings you can configure with this powerful plugin, but don't go nuts at first. Just start playing around with it and get a feel for managing things via kanban boards before you get too crazy.
