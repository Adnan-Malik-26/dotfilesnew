The Command Palette is one of the most underrated features in Obsidian. By using the keyboard shortcut **âŒ˜-P**, you can quickly trigger powerful actions right from your keyboard.

But did you know that you can also use the Command Palette to discover what actions are available when you install a new plugin?

Just start typing the name of the plugin and the autocomplete feature will quickly surface the available actions.

This is the first thing I do once I install a new community plugin as it helps me discover what the plugin can actually do.
