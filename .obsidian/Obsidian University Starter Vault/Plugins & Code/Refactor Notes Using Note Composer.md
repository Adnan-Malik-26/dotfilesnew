In the previous tip, I shared how it can be useful to break down your notes into the smallest logical pieces. But when you're first starting, you may have a lot of imported notes that are pretty big.

So how do you break those notes apart into smaller ones?

Obsidian has a Core plugin called _Note Composer_ that allows you to do this pretty easily. Here's how it works:

1. Highlight the text you want to break apart into a separate note
2. Right-click and select _Extract Current Selection_
3. Select the file you want to merge the text into, or create a new note by typing the title and hitting Enter

Your highlighted text is then moved to the new note, and a link to the note with the text is added to the original note.
