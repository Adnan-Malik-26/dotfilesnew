While I generally try to keep my notes short using the _Atomic Notes_ idea I mentioned in a previous tip, occasionally I have longer notes I break up by using multiple headers.

For these types of notes, the _Outline_ core plugin is invaluable for displaying and navigating the contents of the note.

One of the places this comes in handy for me is with the notes for the books that I read. I take notes in MindNode, then bring the mind map and the Markdown notes themselves into a single note. The headers show up in the Outline view, and clicking on a header (i.e. a chapter from the book) instantly jumps to that part of the note.

Lower-level headers are nested inside of higher-level headers. For example, the Chapter 3 link I click in the animated gif above is a third-level header, so it appears nested below the second-level **Fundamentals** header. Clicking on the disclosure triangle allows you to fold and unfold header levels if you want to clean up the visual clutter of longer outlines.

To turn this on:

1. Go to **Settings â†’ Core Plugins**
2. Toggle on the **Outline** core plugin

Once toggled on, you can open the outline and drag it into the sidebar if you want the outline of the current note easily accessible.
