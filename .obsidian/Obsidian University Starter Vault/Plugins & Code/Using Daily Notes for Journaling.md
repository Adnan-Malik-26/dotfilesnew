One of the most surprising workflows I have absolutely fallen in love with in Obsidian is using the _Daily Notes_ core plugin for daily journaling.

All you really need to start journaling in Obsidian is to enable the _Daily Notes_ core plugin in the Settings, but here are a couple of other tips to help take your Obsidian journaling to the next level.

1. Install the [Calendar](https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-calendar-plugin) community plugin so you can navigate to and create Daily Notes easily from the sidebar
2. Create a template for your Daily Notes that automatically gives you the prompts you need

Once you have these set up, you can click on a new date and it will pre-populate the note with the template youâ€™ve set up.

There's a lot you can do with journaling prompts in Obsidian. I like to use a method called _Daily Questions_ that I picked up from Marshall Goldsmith in his book [Triggers](https://amzn.to/3bJsNrk). It's a bit complicated, so if you want to know more about how I implemented it [here's a YouTube video I recorded](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ev0E-5u5WI).

And if you want to use my Daily Notes template as a starting point, here's my current [[Daily Notes Template v1 (Daily Questions)]].

To use your own Daily Notes template file,

1. Enable the _Daily Notes_ core plugin
2. Select the _Daily Notes_ option in the Settings sidebar
3. Select the file you want to use for the _Template File Location_

Once you have a template set up, it will use it every time you click the button (or the date on the calendar plugin) to create a new Daily Note.
