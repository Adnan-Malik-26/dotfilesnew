While it's easy to find a note using the File Explorer and even easier to locate it using the _Quick Switcher_, it can still be handy to save a list of frequently access notes as favorites using the _Starred_ core plugin.

The _Starred_ plugin is not enabled by default. To enable it:

1. Go to **Settings â†’ Core Plugins**
2. Enable the **Bookmarks** plugin

Once enabled, you'll have another option available to the left of the editor which shows your bookmarked notes.

To mark a note as a favorite, click the **More Options** button and select **Bookmark**. Once starred, the note will show up in the **Bookmarks** section. You can even create folders to keep your bookmarks organized.

I use this for notes that I need to access frequently, like course notes that I add to during each session. Once I'm done with the course (I no longer need to access the note frequently), I'll unbookmark the note and remove it from the _Bookmarks_ category.

(FYI you can also bookmark sections or headings in notes, but I don't do this much since I rely on the concept of atomic notes.)
