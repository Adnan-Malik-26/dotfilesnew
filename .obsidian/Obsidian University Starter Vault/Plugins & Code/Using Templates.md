Templates are a great way to jumpstart the creation of a new note, but it requires a core plugin that isn't enabled by default.

To turn on templates:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Core Plugins**
2. Toggle on the **Templates** core plugin

Once enabled, you'll need to configure the folder you want to use for your templates in the plugin settings. I keep all of my templates inside a _Templates_ folder in my Obsidian vault.

Once this is set, you can add a template to a blank note by using the Command Palette and selecting the **Use Template** command, then selecting the template file you want to use.

You can also use the keyboard shortcut **⌘-T**.

I've collected quite a few of these templates over the years. If you'd like to use them for yourself, I've included them in a subfolder in this sample vault.
