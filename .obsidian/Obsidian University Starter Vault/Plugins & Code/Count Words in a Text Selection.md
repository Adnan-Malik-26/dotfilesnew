Obsidian ships with a core plugin that shows the total words in the active note in the status bar at the bottom of the interface.

But you can extend this to show the words and character count for a portion of selected text by using the [Better Word Count](https://github.com/lukeleppan/better-word-count) community plugin.

With this plugin active, you can get the word and character count for a selection of text simply by highlighting it.

This information appears in addition to the information from the core _Word count_ plugin, so make sure to toggle that one off in **Settings â†’ Core Plugins** to avoid duplicate info appearing in the status bar.
