Pretty much everything about the Obsidian interface is customizable. You can drag thins to different sections of the screen to easily create a layout (or workspace) that fits what you want to do in the app.

But chances are you won't want to use that layout all the time. Fortunately, you can save and recall specific layouts using a feature called _Workspaces_.

To create a Workspace, first make sure you have _Workspaces_ core plugin enabled. Once it's turned on, you can save a Workspace by activating the Command Palette with **âŒ˜-P** and selecting the **Manage Workspace** command, give your current layout a name, and click the **Save** button.

Workspaces involve more than just your panes, though. It will also save anything you've arranged in the sidebars, like the Local Graph, Outline View, etc.

To recall a Workspace, just activate the Command Palette and then select the **Load Workspace** command. Select the workspace you want, and Obsidian will load it.
