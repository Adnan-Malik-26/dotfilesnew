One of the things I loved about writing in Ulysses was the ability to enter _Focus Mode_. This eliminated all the clutter of the toolbars and buttons so you could focus on the words you were writing.

Fortunately, it's possible to recreate the same effect in Obsidian using a community plugin called [Focus Mode](https://github.com/ryanpcmcquen/obsidian-focus-mode).

Here's how to set it up:

1. Go to **Settings â†’ Community Plugins** and click **Browse**
2. Find the **Focus Mode** plugin
3. Click **Install**, and then **Enable**

Once it's installed, you can click the button in the left sidebar to enter Focus Mode and eliminate all other distractions. And if you have multiple tabs open but you want to focus on a single tab, hold the **Shift** key when clicking the Focus Mode button to focus on only the active tab.
