In another tip, I show how you can apply multiple tags at once by [[Nesting Tags]].

But what if you want to rename those tags?

By default, you have to go change every single instance of that tag in every note document in your vault. But with the [Tag Wrangler](https://github.com/pjeby/tag-wrangler) plugin, you can actually rename a tag in the Tag Pane and it will automatically update all the instances of the tag automatically for you.

Just right-click on the tag you want to change, select **Rename**, and Tag Wrangler takes care of the rest.
