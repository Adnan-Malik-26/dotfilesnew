You can actually link together different applications on your Mac or iOS device by using _Callback URLs_. These links are web URLS that tell the system to open a specific document or file instead of webpage.

To get a URL that links directly to a specific note, click on the _More Options_ button and select _Copy Obsidian URL_.

Now you can paste that URL wherever you might need it, like in the description for a task inside your task manager.

When it's time to do the task, your task manager can surface it and you can quickly get to the required note by simply clicking (or tapping, for iOS users) the link.
