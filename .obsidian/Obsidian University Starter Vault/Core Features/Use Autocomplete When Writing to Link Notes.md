This is a simple tip you probably already know how to use, but I'd wager a guess you're not using it as much as you should.

One of the first things you learn in Obsidian is to use double-brackets to create bidirectional links to other notes. But the real payoff happens when you get in the habit of using this consistently to add links as you type.

The minute you think of something that you want to link, use `[[` and start typing the name of the note you want to link - even if it doesn't exist yet.

The autocomplete helps you find the name of the note you want to link to, or you can type the name of the note title you want to create. Hitting the **Enter** key will create the note and the link between the current note and the new one.

Using a note title that doesn't exist yet creates a placeholder. The link is darker to indicate the file doesn't exist yet, but the placeholder will still show up in the graph view so you can see all the links that exist to and from the yet-to-be-created note.

BTW, you can also tell which pages haven't been created yet by a small icon in the results using the Quick Switcher.

If you want to create the note, just click on the link (or dot in the graph view).
