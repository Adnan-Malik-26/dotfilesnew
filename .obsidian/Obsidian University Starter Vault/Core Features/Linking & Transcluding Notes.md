One of the things that first brought me to Obsidian was the ability to create bidirectional links between notes. These links serve as a two-way connection between notes and is displayed in the _Graph View._

You can create a bidirectional link between two notes by using double brackets and inserting the note title, like so:

`[[Atomic Habits]]`

But you can also embed the contents of the linked note in the current note by adding a **!** character in front. Linking to a note this way is known as _transcluding_.

I use this all the time with my [sermon sketchnotes](https://notes.faithbasedproductivity.com/):

I transclude each verse so that I can see the contents of the verse note being referenced without having to open each of those notes individually. And each verse note transcluded this way also shows up in the Graph View.

What's great about transcluding is that you can update the contents of the original note and it will be immediately updated everywhere where that note is transcluded. So instead of updating information across multiple note files, you only have to do it once.
