Obsidian doesn't have a lot of publishing options, but one that I use frequently is _Export to PDF_. It's pretty basic, but does offer a couple of options:

- _Page Size_: you can choose from _A3, A4, A5, Legal, Letter,_ or _Tabloid_.
- _Landscape_: you can toggle on Landscape orientation if you prefer that over portrait.
- _Margin_: you can select _Default, Minimal,_ or _None._
- _Downscale percent_: you can set how much smaller you want to the content to appear on the page.

To export your current note as a PDF file, click the _More Options_ button (the 3 dots in the upper-right corner of the note title bar) and select _Export to PDF_.

Obsidian will spit out a PDF file that you can easily share with others. [Here are my notes](https://share.getcloudapp.com/NQulxrAd) from [Ship 30 for 30](https://enroll.ship30for30.com/august-2022-enrollment/5gmhc) as an example.
