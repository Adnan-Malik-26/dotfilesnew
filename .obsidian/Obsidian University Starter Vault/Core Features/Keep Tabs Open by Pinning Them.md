By default, when you open a new note in Obsidian it will replace the note that is currently open in the active pane with the new note. You can hold the **Command** key when you click a link to open a link in a new tab, but what if you want to make sure that a certain tab never closes?

The answer: you can pin the tab you want to stay open.

There are a couple of ways you can do this:

1. You can click the **More options** button in the title bar for the note you want to stay open and select **Pin**
2. You can activate a tab and then select the **Toggle Pin** command via the Command Palette
3. You can create a keyboard shortcut that allows you to toggle pins via a custom hotkey

Once the note is pinned, a new note that is opened (via the _Quick Switcher_, for example) will open alongside the pinned tab instead of replacing it.

To configure the hotkey:

1. Go to _Settings → Hotkeys_
2. Configure the _Toggle Pin_ shortcut

This hotkey is not configured by default. I have mine set to **⇧⌘⌥⌃P**. That may seem hard to hit the Option, Control, Command, and Shift keys all at once, but I explain how I do that in the tip where I show how to [[Create Hotkeys Without Conflicts Using a Hyper Key]].
