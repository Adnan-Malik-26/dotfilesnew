The Command Palette is one of the most powerful features in Obsidian. You can access it quickly on the desktop by using the keyboard shortcut **âŒ˜-P**.

But how do you get to it on a mobile device without a connected Bluetooth keyboard?

With a simple swipe gesture that iOS users are probably already familiar with.

Just swipe down from anywhere but the top of the screen (that's reserved for _Notifications_ and _Control Center_ on iOS) to access the Command Palette.

It's the exact same gesture that is used to access Spotlight on the iOS Home screen. Which makes sense, since the Command Palette functions a lot like Spotlight for Obsidian in a lot of ways.
