Out of the box, Obsidian has support for basic task management:

1. You can create a task on a line by starting it with **- [ ]** or by hitting the keyboard shortcut **âŒ˜-Return**
2. You can give the task a due date by linking the task to a Daily Note using **[[YYYY-MM-DD]]** formatting.

For example, let's say I want to create a task for writing the Daily Obsidian Tip on creating tasks in Obsidian. I can add the task in any note in Obsidian, and link it to the date it's due by using an internal link that is formatted the same way as the rest of my Daily Notes (as configured in the _Daily Notes_ plugin settings).

For example, this task is due on July 29th, 2023 using the standard **YYYY-MM-DD** formatting.

Once the task is created, I can see when it is due by 1) opening my Daily Note for the day and 2) looking at the _Backlinks_ section in that day's Daily Note.

This way, you can add tasks throughout your Obsidian vault and complete the ones that are due by working off of the Backlinks tab.

There are obvious limitations to this (i.e. no overdue tasks will show up this way), and more powerful task management solutions do exist if that's what you need. But they all build on this basic framework though:

- Tasks exist in Obsidian as either done or not done
- Tasks are linked to Daily Notes for due dates

It's not going to replace a complex task manager like OmniFocus or Things, but if you just want something simple Obsidian's built-in task management features may just work for you.

And you can always extend it using one of several different community plugins if you need something more.
