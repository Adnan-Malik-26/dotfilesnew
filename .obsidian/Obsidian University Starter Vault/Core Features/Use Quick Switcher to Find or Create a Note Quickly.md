The _Quick Switcher_ is one of the core features in Obsidian that is more useful than it first seems. As your vault grows in size, the autocomplete it uses to help you find and open the right note becomes even more valuable.

To use the _Quick Switcher_, use the keyboard shortcut **âŒ˜-O** and start typing the name of the note you want to open. Select the note from the list, and hit **Enter** to open it.

Alternatively, you can type the name of a note that doesn't exist yet and hit **Enter** to create it.

This is useful because as your library grows you may lose track of all the notes you've created. I have almost 50,000 files in my Obsidian vault now, and this helps me recall the notes I've already created that I might want to link to - and what they were named.
