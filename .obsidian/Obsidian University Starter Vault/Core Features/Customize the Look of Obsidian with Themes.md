By default, Obsidian ships with a decent-looking dark mode. But it may not be for everyone. You can actually switch the default theme to _Light Mode_ by going to **Settings → Appearance** and changing **Base Theme** to _Light._

There's also an option to make it the same as the system. But the real interesting stuff is the community themes. To install a community theme:

1. Go to **Settings → Appearance**
2. Go to **Themes** and click **Manage**
3. Find the theme you want and click **Install and Use**
