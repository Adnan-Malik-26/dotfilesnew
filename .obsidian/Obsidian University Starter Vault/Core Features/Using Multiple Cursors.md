One advanced feature a lot of text editors have is the ability to use multiple cursors. This allows you to place cursors at multiple locations in your note that all do the same thing as you type.

For example, maybe you want to change multiple instances of a word to something else. To do this in Obsidian, just hold the **Option** key while you click a location in your note to add an additional cursor. Then when you type, your text will show up in all of your cursor locations at once.
