The left sidebar in Obsidian provides quick access to core features. It allows you to change your vault, get to the settings, open the Graph View, access the Command Palette or Quick Switcher, and a lot more.

But as you install additional plugins, they will occasionally add icons for commands to the sidebar. If you use a bunch of plugins (like I do), this quickly gets unwieldy.

But did you know you can actually hide unwanted icons from the ribbon?

Here's how to do it:

1. Go to the **Settings** and select **Appearance**
2. Under the **Advanced** section, find **Ribbon Menu** and select **Manage**
3. Click the red **-** icon to remove any unwanted commands from the Ribbon

You can always add them back by clicking the green **+** icon next to the item in the *Other RIbbon Items* list.
