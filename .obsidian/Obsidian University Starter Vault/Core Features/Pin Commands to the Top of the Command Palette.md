You can easily access actions in the Command Palette by using the built-in autocomplete. Just start typing and the list will filter in real-time. But did you know you can also pin commands to the top of the Command Palette?

Just go to **Settings â†’ Command Palette** and select the actions you want to pin.

Pinned actions here will also appear at the top of the Command Palette when triggered on iOS if you sync your vault to your iOS device.
