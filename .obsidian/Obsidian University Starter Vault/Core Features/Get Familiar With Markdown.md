Obsidian is a plain text editor that uses Markdown formatting to style text. That means that all text styling has to happen using text markup (not buttons, ribbons, or menus like in a traditional word processor).

Using plain text means that your files are guaranteed to be future-proof (can be opened in any other plain text editor in the future if Obsidian disappears), but also requires that you learn Markdown formatting in order to things like bold, italicize, and underline text.

If you're not familiar with Markdown, it can take a little getting used to. Basically, you need to add character before and after the text you want to style. For example, to bold text, you need to add ****** before and after the text you want to appear as bold.

I've prepped a Markdown Reference note for you of some commonly used text formatting options and the syntax you need to apply them in Obsidian.

(You can see the full list with example code in this [[Markdown Reference]] note.)

If you don't like the idea of styling your text using plain text, there are keyboard shortcuts you can use as well. For example, hitting **⌘-B** when text is selected will make it bold, **⌘-I** will make it italic, **⌘-K** will turn it into a link, etc.

And if you really don't like the idea of using Markdown (or just want some help until you get it under your fingers), there's a plugin called [cMenu](https://github.com/chetachiezikeuzor/cMenu-Plugin) that adds a text editing modal for a smoother writing experience.

This floats on top of your text and gives you quick access to some of the more common text formatting commands you might have need of without having to memorize the Markdown formatting.
