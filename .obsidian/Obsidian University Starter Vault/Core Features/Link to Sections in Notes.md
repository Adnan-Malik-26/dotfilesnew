You may know that you can link to other notes in Obsidian by using `[[`, but did you know you can link to specific section in those notes as well?

To start, link to the note you want by using `[[` and typing the name of the note. Once you have the name of the note, you can link to a couple of different sections in the note:

- You can use **#** to link to a specific header
- You can use **âŒƒ** to link to a specific block

As you can see, clicking on the link takes me straight to that specific section of the note. However, the block ID looks kind of messy sitting at the end of that link.

Fortunately, you can change how the link is displayed by adding a pipe character and then typing the text you want the link to display as.

Keep in mind that blocks and headers don't show up in the Local Graph though - only notes do. So if you're going to use Local Graph heavily (which I recommend), you should consider breaking your longer notes apart in atomic notes instead.
