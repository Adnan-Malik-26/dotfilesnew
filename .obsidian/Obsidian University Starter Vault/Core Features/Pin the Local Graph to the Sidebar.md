The Local Graph is my favorite way to see how my notes connect because it only shows:

1. The current note
2. Any note that current note links to
3. Any notes that link to the current note

You might be aware that you can open the Local Graph via the Command Palette using the keyboard shortcut **âŒ˜-P** and then selecting **Open Local Graph**. But did you know that you can drag the Local Graph into the sidebar?

What's really cool about this is that it automatically updates when you open a new note.
