The Markdown formatting Obsidian uses can be a little confusing with your dealing with local image files. Since Markdown images are based on URLs, the way to add an image is to use the following formatting:

`![[fileurl.jpg]]`

But you don't have to find some fancy way to grab those URLs from files on your computer in order to add them to Obsidian. All you need to do is drag the file into the note. The file will be added to Obsidian and the URL will be created.

I use a menu bar shelf app called [Dropzone](https://aptonic.com/) that allows me to add things I want to move later. It's kind of like a holding tank for files that I want to move across screens. When I want to move something from Dropzone into Obsidian, I just use a keyboard shortcut to activate it and then drag the file in like so:
