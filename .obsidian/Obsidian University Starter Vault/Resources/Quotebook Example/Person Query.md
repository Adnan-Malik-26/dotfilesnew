In order to use this query properly, you'll need to:

1. Install and enable the [Obsidian BRAT](obsidian://show-plugin?id=obsidian42-brat) community plugin
2. Use the Command Palette (âŒ˜-P) and run the *Plugins: Add a beta plugin for testing* command.
3. Past the Github URL for the [Query Control](https://github.com/nothingislost/obsidian-query-control) plugin
4. Enable the Query Control plugin in the Community Plugins list

*This doesn't come pre-installed because some people may not be comfortable with running an experimental beta plugin.*

Here's a video tutorial on how to set this up:
