This starter vault has 50+ quick tips to help you get more out of your notes and ideas in Obsidian. It covers everything from essential settings and key personal knowledge management mindsets to recommended plugins & example workflows.

The tips in this vault are broken into 5 categories:

- [[Core Features]]
- [[PKM 101]]
- [[Plugins & Code]]
- [[Keyboard Kung-Fu]]
- [[Apps & Services]]

Each link takes you to a page with a Dataview query that shows a table view of all the tips in that category and their associated tags.

I've also included a folder full of my personal templates that you can use to make creating notes faster & easier in Obsidian. If you're not sure how to use templates in Obsidian, make sure you check out the [[Using Templates]] tip first.

*P.S. Don't be scared by the message that asks if you trust the author of the vault. I've pre-installed all the plugins and configured the settings so that you can try out any of the tips documented here (minus the ones that require other apps obviously).*
