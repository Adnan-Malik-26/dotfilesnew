There are a ton of customizable hotkey commands in Obsidians. We've covered a few of them, but as you add plugins there are potentially hundreds of them. How will you ever remember what hotkey you set to a specific command?

Fortunately, it's easy to rediscover them without having to go back into the _Settings_ because the Command Palette displays the hotkeys next to the commands.

Just use the shortcut **âŒ˜-P** to open the Command Palette, and search for the command whose hotkey you want to rediscover.
