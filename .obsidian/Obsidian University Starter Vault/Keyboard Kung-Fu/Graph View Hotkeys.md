If you've spent some time poking around Obsidian, you probably stumbled on the _Graph View_ via the button in the left sidebar.

But did you know there's a default hotkey associated with this Graph View (**âŒ˜-G**)?

There are also configurable hotkeys for a couple of other Graph View options:

The first is the **Graph View: Start Graph Timelapse Animation** command, which starts a timelapse of notes being added to your Obsidian vault:

FYI this timelapse command is only available when viewing the Graph View.

The second is the **Graph View: Open Local Graph** command, which opens a new pane and displays the Local Graph for the current note and all connecting notes.

This Local Graph command is only available when a note is open in Obsidian.

You can configure each of these commands in the **Hotkeys** section in the Obsidian settings.

I don't use the _Graph View_ a ton, but every once in a while, I find it handy to have these commands quickly accessible via the keyboard.
