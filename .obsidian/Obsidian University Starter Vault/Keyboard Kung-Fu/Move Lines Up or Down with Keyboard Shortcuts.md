There are lots of really cool things you can do in Obsidian using keyboard shortcuts. One of those is moving the current line up or down a line.

To set up this keyboard shortcut, go to **Settings â†’ Hotkeys** and search for _Move Line Up_ or _Move Line Down_. Click the Star button and select the keyboard shortcut you want to assign to the action.
