Obsidian has a couple of different "views" or modes:

1. _Edit View_ is what you use when you are creating your notes
2. _Reading View_ is what you use when you are reading your notes

As you work in Obsidian, you will probably find yourself switching back and forth between these views. You can click the icon in the title of the tab to go back and forth, but you may want a quicker way to switch between them.

Fortunately, you can use a hotkey to switch back and forth between _Edit_ and _Reading_ views.

To set up this hotkey:

1. Go to **Settings â†’ Hotkeys**
2. Set the hotkey for the _Toggle Reading View_ command

With the addition of the _Live Preview_ feature, this isn't as mandatory as it once was. But as you can see in the gif above with my Dashboard note, there are still plenty of times when this comes in handy.
