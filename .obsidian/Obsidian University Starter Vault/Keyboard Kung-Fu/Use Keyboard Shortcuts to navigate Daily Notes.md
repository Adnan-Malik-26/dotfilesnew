In a previous tip, I talked about setting up Daily Notes for journaling in Obsidian and jumping to specific days using the Calendar plugin. But another way I love to navigate my Daily Notes is by using keyboard shortcuts.

There are actually hotkeys in Obsidian for going forward or backward when viewing your Daily Notes.

To configure the shortcuts:

1. Go to _Settings â†’ Hotkeys_
2. Configure the _Daily Notes: Open Next Daily Notes_ and _Daily Notes: Open Previous Daily Note_ shortcuts

There's an additional Hotkey you may want to configure called _Daily Notes: Open Today's Daily Note_. Setting a keyboard shortcut to this hotkey would allow you to jump straight to today's Daily Note without having to take your fingers off the keyboard.
