In a previous tip, I shared how you can open notes in a new tab by holding the _Command_ key when you click the note link. This can be useful for opening a bunch of notes, but what if you want to clear out the clutter and start over?

The answer is to use the _Close all other tabs_ shortcut. This will close all other tabs except the one that is currently active.

To set this hotkey:

1. Go to **Settings → Hotkeys**
2. Set the hotkey for the _Close all other tabs_ command

The default Obsidian hotkey to close a tab is **⌘-W**. Therefore, I like to use **⇧-⌘-W** for my _Close all other tabs_ hotkey.
