When you click on a link to another note (a link with double brackets), by default it will open the link in a the current tab.

But if you hold the _Command_ key when you click on the link, Obsidian will open the note in a new tab.

I find this useful when I want to study my sermon notes. I'll open the verse I want to study in one tab, then **âŒ˜-click** on the sermon notes I want to open in other tabs. You can then drag those tabs into different areas of the Obsidian interface.

This lets me see and study multiple notes side-by-side.
