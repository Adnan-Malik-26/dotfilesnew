If you work with tabs in Obsidian, you may occasionally accidentally close a tab that you were still working in.

When this happens, you don't have to go back to the File Explorer and reopen it. Instead, you can use the keyboard shortcut **⇧-⌘-T** to reopen the last tab you closed.

This command is called _Undo Close Tab_ and can also be triggered via the Command Palette. It's one of the default keyboard shortcuts, so you shouldn't have to configure this one before you start using it.
