There are a ton of commands in Obsidian that you can trigger using custom hotkeys. But one thing you need to be careful of is making hotkeys that conflict with other keyboard shortcuts on your system.

One way to avoid this is to make hotkeys that have to use a bunch of modifier keys. Modifier keys are keys like Shift (⇧), Option (⌥), Command (⌘), or Control (⌃) that you use with other character keys on your keyboard.

Using all four of these modifier keys in a single hotkey is difficult to do, so any hotkey you would create using all of them is basically guaranteed not to conflict with anyone else on your system. And if you want an easier way to trigger these complex hotkeys, you can create a _Hyper Key_ that simulates pressing them all at once.

One of the easiest ways to create a Hyper Key is to use an app called [BetterTouchTool](https://folivora.ai/). With BetterTouchTool, you can set up your Caps Lock key to function as a Hyper Key and simulate pressing all four modifier keys at once.

Here's how to set it up:

1. First, select _All Apps_ in the left sidebar. Then select _Keyboard Shortcuts_ from the drop-down at the top of the window and click the + button to create your first keyboard shortcut.
2. Next, assign the key you want to use as the Hyper Key by pressing it. I always use Caps Lock because I never use it for anything else.
3. Next, add the action you want to the key press by clicking the + button. Use the search field to locate the _Act as Hyper Key_ option and click it.

Once you have it set up, you can make unique hotkeys in Obsidian quickly and easily. For example, the tip yesterday where I showed my _Toggle Pin_ hotkey (**⇧⌘⌥⌃P**) is really just **Caps Lock - P**.
