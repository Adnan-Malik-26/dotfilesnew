A caveat before I share today's Obsidian tip: I don't actually use this one because I only read physical books. [I've documented my whole process here](https://faithbasedproductivity.com/how-i-take-notes-on-books-i-read/) if you're interested, but I completely get the allure of digital books and understand it's the better fit for most people.

And if you're going to read digital books, you should absolutely sync your digital highlights to Obsidian using the [official Readwise community plugin](https://github.com/readwiseio/obsidian-readwise).

With [Readwise](https://readwise.io/), you can import your digital highlights (i.e. from your Kindle account) and then those highlights will sync over to Obsidian once you have the plugin setup. It works with books and articles, and the plugin can even sort them into appropriate sub-folders inside your Obsidian vault automatically.

Here's how to do it:

1. Install the [official Readwise community plugin](https://github.com/readwiseio/obsidian-readwise)
2. Go to the plugin settings and click **Connect** to sync the plugin with your Readwise account
3. Configure the settings for Readwise via the web (i.e. the folder names where you want to store books, articles, etc.)
4. Configure the settings for the plugin in Obsidian (i.e. the root folder in your vault where you want notes stored, the resync frequency, whether you want to resync when Obsidian opens)
5. Click the **Run Sync** button (or use the sync command via the Command Palette)

Your digital highlights will now show up in your Obsidian vault.

Once it's configured, the digital reading workflow is pretty slick:

1. You highlight things you want to keep via your Kindle or e-reader synced with your Kindle account
2. Those highlights get imported into Readwise
3. Your Readwise changes get synced to Obsidian

I've tried this workflow, and it's magical. It's almost enough to get me to switch to digital from physical books.

_Almost._
