I'm a big fan of time tracking, but it can be difficult to remember to start and stop timers manually. Fortunately, [Timing](https://timingapp.com/?lang=en) makes time tracking easy by automatically tracking all the time you spend on your Mac and classifying it based on the apps that you used. You can even create drag-and-drop rules to automatically track time in specific apps (or even specific websites or documents) to individual projects. For example, time spent on Twitter could be automatically classified as "Unproductive" but time spent writing in Obsidian could be classified as "Productive."

All of this data gets tabulated for you visually in a dashboard so you can see easily where your time went. This dashboard can be illuminating because how you think you spent your time is not always how you actually spent your time. And in the dashboard, you can see it broken down by project. For example, yesterday I spent 43 minutes working on Daily Obsidian Tips.

But the interesting thing here is that you can get really granular with the rules you create. For example, I can track time spent on one note toward one project and time spent on another note towards another. Here's a breakdown showing the time spent on the _Daily Obsidian Tips_ note, which is being counted towards the _Daily Obsidian Tips_ project in Timing.

(I'm also counting the time I spent writing the tip in ConvertKit via the Brave browser towards this project in the screenshot above. Kind of cool that you can track time on specific websites this way.)

In order for Timing to see the note titles like this though and allow you to classify the time spent on them to the appropriate project, you need to install the [Open Note to Window Title](https://github.com/jplattel/open-note-to-window-title) plugin in Obsidian. Once you do, you can create a rule in Timing holding down the **Option (‚å•)** key while dragging the time entry to the appropriate project.

Once the rule is created, Timing will automatically classify time spent on that note to the appropriate project automatically in the future.

_(FYI, Timing is a subscription but is also currently included in a [SetApp](https://setapp.sjv.io/Y9NgZR) subscription, where you can get access to a whole bunch of quality Mac apps for $9.99/month.)_
