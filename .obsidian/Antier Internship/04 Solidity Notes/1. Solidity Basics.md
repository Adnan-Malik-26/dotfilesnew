There are no direct string comparison in Solidity.

strings are compared by converting into hashes and then compared.

syntax: (keccak256(abi.encodePacked("string1")) == keccak256(abi.encodePacked("string 2")))

Here string1 and string2 are being compared

1 ether = 10^18 wei
1 gwei = 10^3 wei

To log the events we must use event keyword and log it.

Syntax event DataStored(string Name, uint Amount);
